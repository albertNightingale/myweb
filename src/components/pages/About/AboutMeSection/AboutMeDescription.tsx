        I had a few internships during my time at the University of Utah. In 2019, I interned at Pure Storage as a
        Business Intelligence Developer. There, I built an address verification system for invoice. In 2020, I interned
        at Pure Storage again as a Cost Automation Engineer. I built a quote automation tool for the Cost team that
        serves as the backbone of the team's operation today. In 2022, I joined Amazon as a Software Development
        Engineer Intern in Alexa Skills Kit (ASK). During my time at Amazon, I built a tool that allows the team to
        easily track the building process of Alexa Skills. this allows the team to easily orchestrate any tickets to the
        sibling teams.
