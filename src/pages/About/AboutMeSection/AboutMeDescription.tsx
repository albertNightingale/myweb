        I graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
        My emphasis in the program was Web Development, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

        I had a few internships during my time at the University of Utah. 
        In 2019, I interned at Pure Storage as a Business Intelligence Developer. 
        There, I built an address verification system for invoice. 
        In 2020, I interned at Pure Storage again as a Cost Automation Engineer. 
        I built a quote automation tool for the Cost team that serves as the backbone of the team's operation today.
        In 2022, I joined Amazon as a Software Development Engineer Intern in Alexa Skills Kit (ASK). 
        During my time at Amazon, I built a tool that allows the team to easily track the building process of Alexa Skills. 
        this allows the team to easily orchestrate any tickets to the sibling teams.
